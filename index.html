      <h3><b>MY JOURNEY</b></h3>
	  <p>YEAR 2015-16 : This is the year when I passed class 10th...I wasn't sure what I have to do in future as in career..well i targeted for 10 cgpa 
	  couldn't get..got a 9.8,it was okay but still i had in mind that i could have done better..even teachers expected a 10..now 
	  
	 here comes a big step what subject to choose(stream) I wasn't too sure about science never had much interest in it..but relatives and 
	 family got me into it..i was like okay i"ll do it..then my father sent me to kota i had no idea ..where i am heading to,I was the kind of a
	 girl who never even went to the grocery store by myself..n i was going to kota..yeah you heard it right..kota called as the
	 education city..but deep inside only those who lived there knows the truth(how it is actually)..
     so,finally went there took admission..got into some hostel whose monthly rent was 13k,plus ac bill plus other expenses,plus the institute fee..all i had in mind was how are my parents going to pay for this
     and they actually misunderstood the 13k as yearly fee..i know it sounds stupid ..but we live in a village what else you expect us to think
     my school fees was like rs 250 per month...untill 8th..that also used to be a big deal for my parents earlier..ans this time it was like a blast..
     and even after paying this much..the food was like real shit..the worst quality food, i got there..that was one reason i used to skip food and run towards
     fast food  yaa....i got chubby later from 50kg to 65 kg..but what else was the option..so here comes the classes ..i already got admitted late..
     had to recover 2months...and also keep moving with the ongoing syllabus..and it was too much for me..suddenly came out from a village 
     everything was too much for me..plus i got admitted in allen so..they just have a lot of crowd...where teacher has no idea about their own students 
      jee na...kind of money buisness now..so it was like i am on my own..i wasn't too good in studies..but i tried but was not able to cope with it..
      everything was new..and everything was on my own too..so many mixed experience ..also in november 2015 i got chicken pox had to go back to home..for 1  month
      i was home..ya lost even more of the syllabus ..many memories..many stories..ya..there was one more scam from my hostel..they used to 
      take security money in the start...and used to make you sign a contract which stated that you have to stay here for this long..else u won't get the money back
      the actual rule says you should stay unless your one year at coaching completes..but the made another 12 month contract and as many people came late late the ending of 11th
      was not a 12 month period of time..my parents didn't read it..they thought its just a document plus they said that they will adjust the security amount in the rent..just don't pay the last month rent
      but when it came to giving rent ..they were like no we..will give u back the cheque..we need to show that..so pay now we will give you later
      and here comes a boom..they didn't give..i complaint in allen about this..some lady came with me to talk to them about money
   .....now what they did was they changed that lady..contacted someone..and fixed the case..and now the one who came with me
      was like they will only give this much amount..if you want to take then take or else..go..i was like don't know what to say..took watever they
      were giving ..later the lady who came first..i met her she told the whole story..and how they fixed it..all and there i got to know 
      all hostels here play this scam..ya.i met a lot of friends who got into this..and also never got a penny back..so..ya this is kota
       everyone there is doing buisness..the autovala..will charge you way more than the actual amount..will take you down the same route
again and again in order to make you and a fool..and charge you more..all houses will be a p.g..u won't see one house which actually is a house	
      everything is amount money in kota...but ya..i remember the good part..the chineese shop..it was the best spring rolls i had there..
      and the best momos..and manchurian noodles..then the cold coffee shop near the friends bazar...damn..good..plus obvio..ambe burger ..
     its paties,burger,sandwich...everything,it was the best paties i had there...so 11 th passed doing all this.<br>
     YEAR 2016-17: my 12th class..we all got seperated acoording to the marks in 11th..in different batches..life was a lil different now    
     we knew how life runs here..ya i worked a lil more this year..things were good but then something happened..ya some incident..i generally don't
      share that with everyone..so that incident..got me into depression..hell lot of depression..and here the day come to give jee..ya the big day
      believe me i ruined it..too much pressure..plus i didn't study well either..wasn't able to cope..na..so maths was fine..rest tried..
      i knew i won't get marks..my father called asked i didn't say much..he didn't ask more either..came back..i got back home..
      couldn't clear jee..my father was like take any college..everyone was acting weird..as i couldn't do well..but i had in mind..ki
      could have..it was just not my time..i went to grannys and thought will live there and only and study on my own..she asked me tell
     me the problem i told her..i want to repeat but no one is helping me..then she managed to get me back there for one more year ..
     prepration...this time i was focused..no matter what happens.. i had in mind that i willd o it..worked my ass off as i knew this
     was my last chance..many times i had headache..i used to have a saradon and paracetamol combo always..now the really big day came..i couldn't
     sleep whole night..i tried a lot..but really couldn't...went there first..10..15..minutes i don't know what happened to me i didn't do any question
     just this thing..that this is my last chance kept..running on my head..i took a deep breath..went out washed my face came back...did the paper..
     i knew i could have done better..but okay..i didn't know what will happen..came back home..the result day came..i made it..i wanted to live in my state
     as i am a big doll of depression filled manit bhopal..on top..got in the first round..and took admission....	 </p>
